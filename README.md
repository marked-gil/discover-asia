* **Contact Us Page**

    The Contact Us Page begins with a call-to-action statement (Let's Plan Your Holiday!), followed by an instruction, and a form to be filled in.

    In the form, the user is required to provide their name, email, phone number, and destination of choice before they can submit their information. As an option, the user may also supply the time they are available to take phone calls, and a message.

    Before the form inputs can be submitted, users have to agree that a staff member of the agency can contact them via the contact details they provide. This can be done by ticking the checkbox below the message field.

    ![Screenshot of Contact Us page](docs/contact-page.png)

* **404 Page**

    The 404 Page is presented with a simple statement that informs the user who reaches this page that either something has gone wrong when they were navigating the site or what they are looking for is just not in the site. And for the user to easily go back to the home page or even to other pages of the site, a 'Return to Home' button just after the statement is conveniently placed. Also, the navbar at the top is present.

    ![Screenshot of 404 page](docs/404page.png)

* **Contact Form Submission Feedback Page**

    This page is to give immediate feedback to users who wish to contact the agency, by filling out the 'Contact' form and submitting it by clicking its'submit' button, that they have successfully submitted their details. Also, this page provides the following: (1) further information or instruction on what to expect next after the form has been submitted, and (2) an accessible 'Back to Home' button so the user can continue to navigate the site should he/she wishes so.

    ![Screenshot of Contact Form feedback page](docs/contact-feedback-page.png)

* **Newsletter Subscription Feedback Page**

    This feedback page is presented to the user who has successfully submitted their email address via the Newsletter Subscription section on the 'Home' page and 'Destinations' page. It provides him/her information that as their email address has been received, he/she is subscribed to the newsletter. Also, at the bottom of the statements is the 'Back to Home' button to allow the user to continue the visit to the site.

    ![Screenshot of Newsletter feedback page](docs/newsletter-feedback-page.png)

### Features Left to Implement

* To add a sticky button, which functions smoothly and efficiently as a link back to the top of the page (especially in the Home and Destinations pages) and it stays at the bottom right of the viewport. I tried to implement it initially, but it did not work smoothly as I intended, and it was unpredictable. As my knowledge enhances, I wish to visit this project again and implement it.

* To use a HAMBURGER MENU button using Javascript or Bootstrap to enhance responsiveness and style of the navbar.

* To display the client reviews in a carousel or slideshow, especially when viewed in mobile devices.

## Testing

### Responsiveness

This website is fully responsive from the largest screen to the smallest mobile screen size of 280px. 
* This was tested using the web developer tools on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. 
* Also, an online tool called ['Mobile-Friendly Test'](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) was used to test the site's mobile-friendliness as likely more people nowadays are using mobile devices to access the internet.

    ![Mobile-Friendly Test result for Destinations page](docs/mobile-friendly-destinations.png)
    ![Mobile-Friendly Test result for 'Contact Us' page](docs/mobile-friendly-contact-page.png)

### Accessibility

As it is important that people with disabilities have the equal chance of using the web, this site also gives significant consideration to its accessibility.

The site is made with concern for:
* Sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors,
* Distinctness of interactive elements, like links and buttons, through change of styling during mouse hover,
* Consistent placement and styles of similar links and buttons to avoid confusion and for easy navigation of the site,
* Clear association of labels to their respective input fields, such as positioning them adjacent to each other and connecting them with IDs,
* Inclusion of immediate feedback mechanism through: 
    * Giving an immediate indication or warning, which is browser-dependent, next to the input field when the form is submitted without completing the required input field. This is setup by adding the 'required' attribute to the input fields that are necessary to be filled before the form can be submitted.
    * Using a separate feedback page that will show a response when a form (e.g., contact-us form) or input field (e.g., newsletter subscription field) is successfully submitted, and
* The use of **alt** texts on images, and **aria-label** on certain links (such as the social media icons).

To ensure that most of the items mentioned above are achieved, the [WAVE - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was utilized throughout the development of this website.   

Also, this website was tested and passed the SAFARI ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT. See screenshots below:

![Safari Accessibility Audit Result for Home page](docs/safari-accessiblity-home.png)
![Safari Accessibility Audit Result for Destinations page](docs/safari-accessibility-destinations.png)
![Safari Accessibility Audit Result for Contact Us page](docs/safari-accessibility-contact.png)


### Links/Buttons Functionality Testing     

 * This website was **manually tested** on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari) and has been confirmed that all links and buttons are working as intended and are redirecting to the appropriate pages or sections.


### Forms Functionality Testing

* Newsletter Subscription Form

    This form is located on the Home page and Destinations page. And it was manually tested to confirm the following:    
    * When you click on the label ('Provide us your email address below:') above the input field, it will automatically focus or activate the input field, which is a confirmation that they are both linked together.
    * The input field, having the type of email (type="email"), only allows an email format to be entered, and it alerts the user if the format is not followed.
    * The submit button does not work if the input field is not correctly filled out. Instead, an alert or message is displayed to tell the user of what must be done to correct it.
    * The submit button redirects to the newsletter feedback page when the input field is correctly filled out as required.

* 'Contact Us' Form

    This form was manually tested to confirm the following:  
    * All the labels are linked to their corresponding input fields. When the labels are clicked, their respective input fields are activated.
    * Any of the required input fields (such as the first name, last name, email address, phone number, destination of choice, and checkbox), when not filled out, prevents the submission of the form, and displays an alert message. These required items are easily identified by an asterisk symbol at its tail.
    * The 'Destination of Choice' field displays some options to the user while at the same time allows the user to enter his/her own choice without choosing among the options.
    * The input field for the available time of the user is of "time" type (type="time"), and it uses a 24-hour clock.
    * The submit button works and redirects to the 'contact feedback page' when all required input fields are completed.

### Validator Testing

### Fixed Bugs

* **ISSUE:**   
    The images in 'Top Destinations' section had an extra (unwanted) space/gap between its bottom border and that of the containing block despite giving the width of 100% to the image.

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**
        I expect the images to completely fill their immediate containers without gaps or spaces between them.

    * **SOLUTION:**     
        After researching the internet for a solution, I found in Stackoverflow an explanation for it, which is a reminder that an img is an inline element. That being so, it sits on a line where its 'descenders', which extend below the baseline like the letters in the alphabet, will create an extra space below it. So, to solve the problem, I modified the particular image elements as 'block' elements using 'display: block'.
        
        Here is the link for the Stackoverflow explanation: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804256/image-inside-div-has-extra-space-below-the-image).

* ISSUE:    
    The text contents inside the BUTTONS of the sections move slightly downward during hover, and the page moves along with it.

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**    
        I want the 'background color' and 'text color' of the button to switch and a '3px solid border' to be created during hover, without affecting or changing the width and/or height of the button. Also, I do not want the button to oddly move the page even slightly when the button is hovered.

    * **SOLUTION:**     
        After realizing that a border has its own width and height, and could be the cause of increasing the length of the entire button during hover, I added 'box-sizing' property with value of 'border-box' on the hovered button so the height and width of the border that is created during hover will be contained or absorbed in the width and height of the button, and not be add in to it.

* **ISSUE:**    
    On the 'feedback pages' for Newsletter Subscription form and Contact Submission form, there is a gap between the bottom borders of the footer and the viewport which is evident when the window's height is increased. This happens as the main contents are few and therefore cannot push the footer to the bottom of the viewport all the time. You can find these specific pages at these links: [Newsletter Form Feedback Page](https://marked-gil.github.io/discover-asia/subscription-feedback.html) | [Contact Form Feedback Page](https://marked-gil.github.io/discover-asia/contact-feedback.html)

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**
    I expect the footer to, at least, stay at the bottom of the viewport despite the size or height of the main content.

    * **SOLUTION:**     
    To solve the issue, I gave a height of 100% (height: 100%) on the html element; while on the body element, I assigned a 'flex' value to the 'display' property (display: flex) with 'flex-direction' of 'column' (flex-direction: column) and a 'min-height' of 100% (min-height: 100%); and on the main content, I gave the 'flex' property a grow value of 1, a shrink value of 0, and a basis value of auto (flex: 1 0 auto). This then pushed the footer down to the very end despite the size or height of the main content of the page. This solution was suggested by Brian Frain in his book entitled, **'Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS'**.

## Deployment
---

### Version Control

In the development of this website, **git** was a crucial tool used to track changes made in the repository. The following git commands were mostly used:      

* **git status** - to show the status of the repository by displaying the files that have been staged and ready for commit, those that are not, and those that are untracked.

* **git add \<file name>** - to add file or changes in the file to the staging area before they can be commited

* **git commit -m "message"** - to add/record file or changes to the local repository

* **git push** - to upload the local repository to the remote repository, such as GitHub

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The website is published on Github Pages. The following are the steps in deploying the site:
1. Inside the Github repository of 'discover-asia', click on 'Settings' on the menu just below the respository name.
2. Then, among the options on the left sidebar, click on 'Pages'.
3. On the right side of the sidebar, look for 'Source', and under that is a dropdown menu for 'Branch'.
4. Click on the dropdown menu for Branch, and select 'main'.
5. Then, click 'Save' button. The deployed website will be 'live' after few minutes.

### Content

* **Texts**     
    The text contents of the website are originally written for the site by me - the creator.   

    For the DESTINATION page's main content (such as the description for each country) to be factual, I have researched on multiple sites, especially travel websites, where I based most of the texts from.
    
* **References: Go-to Sites for CSS & HTML**    
    My main reference for learning and reviewing CSS and HTML are:
    * [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), 
    * [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and 
    * [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) lectures.   

* **'Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS by Ben Frain'** Book

    The idea on how to keep the footer at the bottom edge of the viewport (i.e. when there is no sufficient main content to push the footer at the endmost part) is from this book by Ben Frain. This is useful on the 'form submission feedback' page and the 'subscription feedback' page where the contents do not always have enough height, especially on large screens, to stick the footer at the bottommost part. (See solution and explanation on the **'Fixed Bugs'** section).
