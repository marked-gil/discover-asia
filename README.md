## Testing
---
### Responsiveness

This website is made fully responsive from the largest screen to the smallest mobile screen size of 280px. 
* This was tested using the web developer tools on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. 
* Also, an online tool called ['Mobile-Friendly Test'](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) was used to test the site's mobile-friendliness as likely more people nowadays are using mobile devices to access the internet.

### Accessibility

As it is important that people with disabilities have the equal chance of using the web, this site also gives significant consideration to its accesibilitiy.

The site is made with concern for:
* Sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors,
* Distinctness of interactive elements, like links and buttons, through change of styling during mouse hover,
* Consistent placement and styles of similar links and buttons to avoid confusion and for easy navigation of the site,
* Clear association of labels to their respective input fields, such as positioning them adjacent to each other and connecting them with same IDs,
* Inclusion of immediate feedback mechanism through: 
    * Giving an immediate indication or warning, which is browser dependent, next to the input field when the form is submitted without completing the required input field. This is setup by adding the 'required' attribute in the input fields that are necessary to be filled before the form can be submitted.
    * Using a separate feedback page that will show a response when a form (e.g., contact-us form) or input field (e.g., newsletter subscription field) is successfully submitted, and
* The use of **alt** texts on images, and **aria-label** on certain links (such as the social media icons).

To ensure that most of the items mentioned above are achieved, the [WAVE - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was utilized through the development of this website.

### Fixed Bugs

* **ISSUE:**    
    At max-width: 1029px, the sticky 'Back to Top' link became positioned behind 'Top Destinations' images, thus concealing part of the 'Back to Top' link.

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**     
        What I expect the 'Back to Top' link to do is to always stay infront of all elements so it is always 'clickable' wherever in the page it is seen.

    * **SOLUTION:**    
        I found out that the images were given a z-index of 1, also the texts on top of the images have z-index of 2. And so, to fix it, I gave the 'Back to Top' link a z-index of 3. So now the 'Back to Top' link is always in front of any element.

* **ISSUE:**   
    My images in 'Top Destinations' section had an extra (unwanted) space/gap between its bottom border and that of the containing block despite giving the width of 100% to the image.

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**
        I expect the images to completely fill their immediate containers without gaps or spaces between them.

    * **SOLUTION:**     
        After researching the internet for a solution, I found in Stackoverflow an explanation for it, which is a reminder that an img is an inline element. That being so, it sits on a line where its 'descenders', which extend below the baseline like the letters in the alphabet, will create an extra space below it. So, to solve the problem, I modified the particular image elements as 'block' elements using 'display: block'.
        
        Here is the link for the Stackoverflow explanation: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804256/image-inside-div-has-extra-space-below-the-image).

* ISSUE:    
    The text contents of the BUTTONS of particular sections move slightly downward and the page along with it during hover.

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**    
        I want the 'background color' and 'text color' of the button to switch and a '3px solid border' to be created during hover, without affecting or changing the width and/or height of the button. Also, I do not want the button to oddly move the page even slightly when button is hovered.

    * **SOLUTION:**     
        After realizing that a border has its own width and height, and could be the cause of increasing the lenght of the entire button during hover, I added 'box-sizing' property with value of 'border-box' on the hovered button so the height and width of the border that is created during hover will be contained or absorbed in the width and height of the button, and not be add in to it.

* **ISSUE:**    
    On the 'feedback pages' for Newsletter Subscription form and Contact Submission form, there is a gap between the bottom borders of the footer and the viewport which is evident when the window's height is increased. This happens as their main contents (which are texts only) are few and therefore cannot push the footer to the bottom of the viewport all the time. You can find these specific pages in these links: [Newsletter Form Feedback Page](https://marked-gil.github.io/discover-asia/subscription-feedback.html) | [Contact Form Feedback Page](https://marked-gil.github.io/discover-asia/contact-feedback.html)

    * **INTENDED OUTCOME:**
    I expect the footer to, at least, stay at the bottom of the viewport despite of the size of main content.

    * **SOLUTION:**     
    To solve the issue, I gave a height of 100% (height: 100%) on the html element; on the body element, I assigned a 'flex' value to the 'display' property(display: flex) with 'flex-direction' of 'column' (flex-direction: column) and a 'min-height' of 100% (min-height: 100%); and on the main content, I gave the 'flex' property a grow value of 1, a shrink value of 0, and a basis value of auto (flex: 1 0 auto). This then pushed the footer down to the very end despite the space occupied by the main content of the page. This solution was suggested by Brian Frain in his book entitled, **'Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS'**.

### Unfixed Bugs

* In a Safari browser and in an iPhone (regardless of browser), when I tap on the 'Back to Top' button, it will create a blue border around the logo in the navbar.   

    Tests made:
    * On a DESKTOP and using Firefox, Edge, and Chrome browsers -> NO blue border around logo appears.
    * On a DESKTOP and using Safari browser -> Blue borders appears.
    * On an iPhone and using Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge browsers -> Blue borders appears.      

    The 'Back to Top' button is linked to the ID of the logo to bring the whole page back to the top, but the behavior of the logo in Safari and in iPhone is something I did not expect. I implemented the same method of linking one element to another element via their ID through the images of the 'Top Destinations', which will redirect to a specified section in the Destinations page. This one works fine and no unexpected issue unlike that of the logo and the 'Back to Top' button.    

    I am still looking for answers to this so I can fix this bug.

## Deployment
---

### Version Control

In the development of this website, **git** was a crucial tool used to track changes made in the repository. The following git commands were mostly used:      

* **git status** - to show the status of the repository by displaying the files that have been staged and ready for commit, those that are not, and those that are untracked.

* **git add \<file name>** - to add file or changes in the file to the staging area before they can be commited

* **git commit -m "message"** - to add/record file or changes to the local repository

* **git push** - to upload the local repository to the remote repository, such as GitHub

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The website is published on Github Pages. The following are the steps in deploying the site:
1. Inside the Github repository of 'discover-asia', click on 'Settings' on the menu just below the respository name.
2. Then, among the options on the left sidebar, click on 'Pages'.
3. On the right side of the sidebar, look for 'Source', and under that is a dropdown menu for 'Branch'.
4. Click on the dropdown menu for Branch, and select 'main'.
5. Then, click 'Save' button. The deployed website will be 'live' after few minutes.

### Content

* **Texts**     
    The text contents of the website are originally written for the site by me - the creator.   

    For the DESTINATION page's main content (such as the description for each country) to be factual, I have researched on multiple sites, especially travel websites, where I based most of the texts from.
    
* **References: Go-to Sites for CSS & HTML**    
    My main reference for learning and reviewing CSS and HTML are:
    * [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), 
    * [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and 
    * [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) lectures.   

* **'Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS by Ben Frain'** Book

    The idea on how to keep the footer at the bottom edge of the viewport (i.e. when there is no sufficient main content to push the footer at the endmost part) is from this book of Ben Frain. This is useful on the 'form submission feedback' page and the 'subscription feedback' page where the contents do not always have enough height, especially on large screens, to stick the footer at the bottommost part. (See solution and explanation on the **'Fixed Bugs'** section).
